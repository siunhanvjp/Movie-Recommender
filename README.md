# Movie Recommender


## Goals

Given a movie name, provide a list of recommendation based on different aspect of the movies (genres, keyword, description, cast, director).

The data is from Kaggle __[TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)__, which contain movies up until 2017.

Here we are given 2 dataset:
* tmdb_5000_movies.csv: has metadata about the movies (genres, title, keywords, etc.)
* tmdb_5000_credits.csv: has information about the cast, crew behind the movies

## Method


## Results

Based on the initial list of favorite books, which mainly contain One Piece managa. Both recommendation method provides a decent result that contains mostly One Piece and Naruto manga

## Future Work
